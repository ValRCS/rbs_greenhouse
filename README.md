## Data Science basics

Data science is like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, you're uncovering hidden truths and secret patterns in mountains of data!

You'll use all kinds of cool tools and techniques from statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence and your own expertise to explore data from all sorts of sources. And the best part is you get to use all of that information to make predictions and decisions that can change the world! 


**Data Science definition**: a field that uses techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from data.

### The process - the "pipeline"

  1. Collecting data
  2. Cleaning and preparing the data
  3. Analyzing the data - Exploratory Data Analysis - Visualization
  4. Using the insights gained to make decisions or predictions - building a model
  5. Deployment - "shipping" - making an app/program/
  6. Monitoring for results / changes / improvements -> Back to Squares (1,2,3,4,5)

### Applications:

  * Predicting product preferences using data from social media
  * Forecasting the likelihood of severe storms using data from weather sensors.
  * Using data from GPS and social media to recommend the best places to eat or hang out with friends in a city.
  * Using data from fitness trackers and wearables to monitor personal health and make personalized workout and nutrition recommendations.
  * Using data from online learning platforms to identify which students are struggling and providing targeted support to help them succeed.
  * Using data from traffic cameras and sensors to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion on roads and highways.
  * Using data from social media to understand public opinion and sentiment on different issues and topics.
  
The above list is just small sampling, there are many more!

## Difference between Data Scientist and Data Engineer

Data scientists and data engineers are both important roles in the field of data science, but they have different responsibilities and focus on different aspects of the data pipeline.

Data scientists are responsible for analyzing and interpreting data, and using that information to make predictions or decisions. They use statistical and machine learning techniques to build predictive models, and they often work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and communicate the results of their analysis.

Data engineers, on the other hand, are responsible for the technical infrastructure and tools that support data science work. They design, build and maintain the systems that collect, store, and process data, and they ensure that data is accurate, reliable, and easily accessible to data scientists and other stakeholders. They work with technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and SQL databases to extract, transform and load the data.

Both roles often overlap.

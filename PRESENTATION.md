# Data Science intro

Data science is like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, you're uncovering hidden truths and secret patterns in mountains of data!

You'll use all kinds of cool tools and techniques from statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence and your own expertise to explore data from all sorts of sources. And the best part is you get to use all of that information to make predictions and decisions that can change the world! 


# Data Science definition


Data science - interdisciplinary field that involves using scientific methods, processes, systems, and infrastructures to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

# Sub-disciplines of Data Science

## Machine learning: 

a subfield of data science that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

# Sub-disciplines of Data Science

## Deep learning: 

a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks to model complex patterns in data

type of mathematical model inspired by the way the human brain works. 
Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that process and transmit information. Each layer of neurons can learn to extract a different level of abstraction from the input data. The more layers a neural network has, the "deeper" it is, thus the term "deep learning".

# Sub-disciplines of Data Science

## Anomaly detection: 

a subfield of data science that deals with identifying unusual or abnormal patterns in data, which can be useful for detecting fraud, errors, or other outliers.

# Sub-disciplines of Data Science

## Data visualization: 
a subfield of data science that deals with the design and creation of visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to communicate information and insights effectively.



# The process - the "pipeline"

  1. Collecting data
  2. Cleaning and preparing the data
  3. Analyzing the data - Exploratory Data Analysis - Visualization
  4. Using the insights gained to make decisions or predictions - building a model
  5. Deployment - "shipping" - making an app/program/
  6. Monitoring for results / changes / improvements -> Back to Squares (1,2,3,4,5)

# Difference between Data Scientist and Data Engineer

Data scientists and data engineers are both important roles in the field of data science, but they have different responsibilities and focus on different aspects of the data pipeline.

# Data Scientist

Data scientists are responsible for analyzing and interpreting data, and using that information to make predictions or decisions. They use statistical and machine learning techniques to build predictive models, and they often work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and communicate the results of their analysis.

# Data Engineer

Data engineers, on the other hand, are responsible for the technical infrastructure and tools that support data science work. They design, build and maintain the systems that collect, store, and process data, and they ensure that data is accurate, reliable, and easily accessible to data scientists and other stakeholders. They work with technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and SQL databases to extract, transform and load the data.

Both roles often overlap.

# Tools of the trade





## Programming Languages
There are several programming languages that are commonly used in data science.

It's worth noting that a data scientist may not necessarily need to know all of these languages but having a strong knowledge of one or two of these is sufficient, as they are often used in combination with other technologies and tools to perform data science tasks.

# Python

Python is a widely-used, high-level programming language that is popular among data scientists because of its simplicity, readability, and wide range of powerful libraries and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. 

Some of the most commonly used libraries for data science in Python include NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

# R: 

R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians, data scientists and academics, and it has a large community that develops and maintains a wide range of packages for data analysis, visualization and modeling.

# SQL: 

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing relational databases. It is widely used to access, retrieve and manipulate data stored in databases, which is often a key component of data science projects.

# Java and Scala: 

Java and Scala are general-purpose programming languages that are widely used in industry. They are popular for big data processing using technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.

# Julia: 

Julia is a high-performance, high-level programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It is designed to be fast and easy to use, and it is gaining popularity among data scientists and researchers.

# Text Editors

 * Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is a popular text editor that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is developed by Microsoft and it offers advanced features such as debugging, code completion, and built-in Git support.

* PyCharm: PyCharm is a powerful, cross-platform text editor that is specifically designed for Python development. It offers advanced features such as code completion, debugging, and integration with version control systems.

* RStudio: RStudio is a powerful, cross-platform text editor that is specifically designed for R development. It offers advanced features such as code completion, debugging, and integration with version control systems.

* Many others, try out different ones

# Other Software

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows data scientists to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is often used in data science to:

Clean and explore data: Jupyter Notebooks allow data scientists to load, manipulate and visualize data in an interactive way, making it easy to understand the data and identify any issues or outliers.

Develop and test models: Jupyter Notebooks allow data scientists to develop, test and iterate on models in an interactive environment. They can quickly test different algorithms and parameters, and visualize the results.

Communicate and share results: Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool for data scientists to communicate their findings and results to others. They can include text, images, and code in one document, which makes it easy to understand the results and the steps that were taken to produce them.

Collaboration: Jupyter Notebooks are also useful for collaboration and reproducibility, as they allow multiple data scientists to work on the same notebook and keep track of the changes made.

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with different languages like Python, R, Julia, Scala, and many more.

# Git and Github

Git is a popular version control system that is widely used in data science for several reasons:

Collaboration: Git allows multiple data scientists to work on the same project and keep track of the changes made by each member. It allows for easy merging of changes made by different team members, and it allows to see the changes made by others in a clear way.

Reproducibility: By using Git, data scientists can keep track of the changes made to the code, data, and documentation. This allows them to reproduce the results of an analysis or experiment at a later date, and also allows others to reproduce the results.

Backup and archiving: Git allows to store the code, data and documentation in a remote repository, like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. This allows data scientists to have a backup of their work, and also allows to access the work from any location.

Experimentation: Git allows data scientists to easily test out different ideas and approaches without affecting the main codebase. They can create different branches, experiment on them and merge the changes back to the main branch if they are successful.

Versioning: Git also allows data scientists to save different versions of their code, data and documentation, which is useful when experimenting with different approaches. It allows to see the differences between versions and allows to go back to a previous version if needed.
